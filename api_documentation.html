Configuration includes the creation, updating, and destruction of swarms and their resources 
in addition to inviting other users' resources into your swarms and accepting or rejecting pending invitations.
Participation includes producing and consuming data within one or many swarms. 
</p><!-- Descriptions--><div class="row"><div class="span8"><h3><a href="configuration_api.html">Configuration </a><small>Establish swarms, resources, and invitations</small></h3><p>BUGswarm uses a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API for configuring swarms
and their resources. This API is used for creating and destroying swarms and resources,
adding and removing resources from swarms, and generating API keys. In addition to these configuration
methods, the RESTful API also takes care of the social aspect of BUGswarm, sending invitations to other users' 
resources to join your swarms as well as accepting and rejecting pending invitations. The RESTful API is not
a streaming API. For each method called, connections are closed after the requests are processed. To make 
development easier, the configuration API has been wrapped up in 
<a href="http://github.com/buglabs/bugswarm-tools">BUGswarm Tools</a>, a set of python scripts used to make the development process simple and easy.
</p></div><div class="span8"><h3><a href="participation_api.html">Participation </a><small>Produce and consume data</small></h3><p>BUGswarm makes use of an HTTP streaming API to participate in a
swarm. The streaming API is used for producing to and consuming
data from a swarm. While it uses HTTP requests, the streaming API is 
<strong>not RESTful</strong>. For each method call, connections remain open while bidirectional HTTP requests are processed.
The streaming API has been wrapped in a set of  
<a href="libraries.html">libraries </a>that make it easy to get your resources participating in swarms as soon as possible. In addition to these
libraries, 
<a href="http://github.com/buglabs/bugswarm-tools">BUGswarm Tools </a>contains produce and consume scripts that allow for simple
command line use of the participation API.
