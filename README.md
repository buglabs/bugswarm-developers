# Welcome to BUGswarm

Acquire data from and control embedded devices using JavaScript or plain old
HTTP.

![][12]

### Group Resources

Combine multiple resources together to create a swarm. Once a member of a
swarm, a resource can communicate and share data with other resources in that
swarm.

### Control Access

Control the level of access a resource has to a swarm. Grant a resource
permission to produce data, consume data, or do both.

### Share With Others

Invite another user's resources into your swarms and accept invitations to
place your resources in somebody else's swarms. Share your data easily and
securely.

## System Swarms of resources

### Resources

A resource is an application or device that is configured to produce or
consume data over BUGswarm. A resource may be a physical device, such as a
smartphone, BUG, or Arduino, as well as a web or mobile application. Anything
than can communicate through HTTP can be configured to join a swarm and being
producing and consuming data.

### Swarms

A swarm is a collection of resources. Once a swarm is created, users may
configure it to allow their own resources to participate as well as invite
another user's resources to become members. The owner of the swarm may control
what level of access (production, consumption, or both) each resource in the
swarm has.

## Getting Started Quick and simple

create a Bug Labs account and use the [API Key Management Tool][6] to list
your given API keys or create new ones.

### 2. Create Resources and Swarms

Use the RESTful [Configuration API][4] to create resources and swarms. Add
resources to swarms as producers, consumers, or both.

### 3. Produce and Consume Data

Use the [Participation API][5] to connect resources to the swarms they are
members of and begin producing and consuming data.
