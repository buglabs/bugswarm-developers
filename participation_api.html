    <h1>Participation API</h1>

    <p>The Participation API is used to connect resources to the
    swarms they are a member of. Once connected, resources may
    produce data, consume data, or do both, depending on their
    level of access to the swarm. Throughout this process, the
    BUGswarm platform generates presence notifications and error
    messages when necessary in addition to passing along the
    messages being produced in the swarm. The Participation API
    makes use of HTTP streaming, meaning that once a connection has
    been opened, bidirectional communication between the resource
    and the swarm may continue until the connection is
    closed.</p><br>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2 id="opening-a-connection">Opening a Connection</h2>
    </div>

    <p>To open a connection between a resource and a swarm, send an
    HTTP <strong>POST</strong> request to the following URL with
    the following headers.</p>

    <h5 class="sub-header">URL:</h5>
    <pre class="prettyprint language-javascript">
'http://api.bugswarm.net/stream?swarm_id=SWARM_ID&amp;resource_id=RESOURCE_ID'
</pre>

    <p>Replace <code>SWARM_ID</code> and <code>RESOURCE_ID</code>
    with the id of the swarm you would like to connect to and the
    resource you would like to connect with. Additionally, you may
    connect the resource to multiple swarms at once by appending
    multiple <code>&amp;swarm_id=SWARM_ID</code> statements to the
    single <code>swarm_id=SWARM_ID</code> that is given above. Keep
    in mind that a resource must be added to the swarm using the
    Configuration API's <a href=
    "restful_swarms.html#add-resource">Add Resource</a> method for
    swarms before it may connect to the swarm and begin producing
    and/or consuming.</p>

    <h5 class="sub-header">Headers:</h5>

    <ul class="unstyled">
      <li><strong>x-bugswarmapikey:</strong> PARTICIPATION_KEY</li>

      <li><strong>transfer-encoding:</strong> chunked</li>

      <li><strong>connection:</strong> keep-alive</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note</strong> that a first chunk must be sent in
    order for the connection to open and resource presence to be
    observed. This first chunk does not need to be in the 'message'
    format described below, or even valid JSON. However, this
    prevent that chunk from being viewed by the swarm.
    Additionally, although this use of HTTP POST allows for
    bidirectional communication, resources will have access to the
    swarm based on whether they are configured as producers,
    consumers, or both.</p>

    <div class="page-header"></div><br>
    <br>

    <div class="page-header">
      <h2 id="sending-messages">Sending Messages</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Once a connection has has been successfully opened for
    production, you may freely send messages from your connected
    resource to the swarm. However, messages must be sent with
    chunked encoding as JSON objects in the following formats.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4 class="sub-header">Chunked Encoding</h4>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <p>Chunked encoding consists of sending a hexadecimal
        representation of the message's size followed by the
        message itself, appending the characters "\r\n" to the end
        of each. More information about chunked encoding can be
        found in section 3.6.1 of <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html">this

                <p>When a resource connects to a swarm, a swarm
                presence notification is sent to each of the
                resources currently connected to that swarm.
                Additionally, the connecting resource receives
                swarm presence notifications from those resources
                that are currently connected. When a resource
                disconnects from a swarm, a swarm presence
                notification of type "unavailable" is sent to each
                of the currently connected resources.</p>

                <p>When a resource connects to its first swarm, a

                resource under that user account that is also
                connected to a swarm. Additionally, the connecting
                resource receives direct presence notifications
                from all other resources under the same user
                account that are already connected to at least one
                swarm. When a resource disconnects from its last
                swarm, a direct presence notification of type
                "unavailable" is sent to each of the resources
                under the same user account that are connected to
                at leaset one swarm.</p>

            <p>Errors are sent to a resource when something has
            gone wrong. This usually means that a resource has
            attempted to use the API to do something that is not
            permited, such as producing to a swarm when it is only
            connected as a consumer or attempting to connect to a
            swarm that it is not a member of. Errors contain a list
            of HTTP codes and descriptions for each error that
            occured during the attempted operation. Some operations
            my cause more than one error, so the list may have more
            than one element.</p>
