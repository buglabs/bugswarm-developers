Participation API
</div><!-- Header--><h1>Participation API</h1><p>The Participation API is used to connect resources to the swarms they are a member of. 
Once connected, resources may produce data, consume data, or do both, depending on their level of access to the swarm.
Throughout this process, the BUGswarm platform generates presence notifications and error messages when necessary in addition to passing
along the messages being produced in the swarm. The Participation API makes use of HTTP streaming, meaning that once a connection has been opened,
bidirectional communication between the resource and the swarm may continue until the connection is closed.
</p><br><div class="page-header"><h2 id="opening-a-connection">Opening a Connection</h2></div><p>To open a connection between a resource and a swarm, send an HTTP 
<strong>POST </strong> request to the following URL with the following headers.
</p><h5 class="sub-header">URL:</h5><pre class="prettyprint language-javascript">'http://api.bugswarm.net/stream?swarm_id=SWARM_ID&amp;resource_id=RESOURCE_ID'
</pre><p>Replace 
<code>SWARM_ID</code> and 
<code>RESOURCE_ID</code>  with the id of the swarm you would like to connect to and the resource you would
like to connect with. Additionally, you may connect the resource to multiple swarms at once by appending multiple 
<code>&swarm_id=SWARM_ID</code> statements to the single 
<code>swarm_id=SWARM_ID</code> that is given above. Keep in mind that a resource must be 
added to the swarm using the Configuration API's 
<a href="restful_swarms.html#add-resource">Add Resource</a> method for swarms before it may connect to the swarm and begin producing and/or consuming.
</p><h5 class="sub-header">Headers:</h5><ul class="unstyled"><li><strong>x-bugswarmapikey: </strong>PARTICIPATION_KEY
</li><li><strong>transfer-encoding: </strong>chunked
</li><li><strong>connection:</strong>keep-alive
</li></ul><p><strong>Note </strong>that a first chunk must be sent in order for the connection to open and resource presence to be observed. This first chunk 
does not need to be in the 'message' format described below, or even valid JSON. However, this prevent that chunk from being viewed by the swarm.
Additionally, although this use of HTTP POST
allows for bidirectional communication, resources will have access to the swarm based on whether they are configured as producers,
consumers, or both.
</p><div class="page-header"></div><br><br><div class="page-header"><h2 id="sending-messages">Sending Messages</h2></div><p>Once a connection has has been successfully opened for production, you may freely send
messages from your connected resource to the swarm. However, messages must be sent with chunked encoding as JSON objects
in the following formats.
</p><li><h4 class="sub-header">Chunked Encoding</h4></li><p>Chunked encoding consists of sending a hexadecimal representation of the message's size followed
by the message itself, appending the characters "\r\n" to the end of each. More information about chunked
encoding can be found in section 3.6.1 of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html">this page</a> as well as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding#Format">Wikipedia</a>.

</p><div class="page-header"></div><br><br><div class="page-header"><h2 id="receiving-messages">Receiving Messages</h2></div><p>Messages will be received in the following formats depending on whether they are public or private.

of the resources currently connected to that swarm. Additionally, the connecting resource
receives swarm presence notifications from those resources that are currently connected. 
When a resource disconnects from a swarm, a swarm presence notification of type "unavailable" is
sent to each of the currently connected resources.
</p><li><h5 class="sub-header">Direct Presence</h5></li><p>When a resource connects to its first swarm, a direct presence notification is sent to each resource under that
user account that is also connected to a swarm. Additionally, the connecting resource
receives direct presence notifications from all other resources under the same user account that are already
connected to at least one swarm. When a resource disconnects from it's last swarm, a direct presence notification of
type "unavailable" is sent to each of the resources under the same user account that are connected to at leaset one swarm. 
</p></div><div class="span8 columns"><h3>Errors</h3><p>Errors are sent to a resource when something has gone wrong.
This usually means that a resource has attempted to use the
API to do something that is not permited, such as producing to a swarm
when it is only connected as a consumer or attempting to connect to a swarm that it
is not a member of. Errors contain a list of HTTP codes and
descriptions for each error that occured during the attempted
operation. Some operations my cause more than one error, so the list
may have more than one element.
