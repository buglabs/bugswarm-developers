        | The BUGswarm API can be broken down into two primary actions, configuration and participation.
        | Configuration includes the creation, updating, and destruction of swarms and their resources 
        | in addition to inviting other users' resources into your swarms and accepting or rejecting pending invitations.
        | Participation inclues producing and consuming data within one or many swarms.

            | BUGswarm uses a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API for configuring swarms
            | and their resources. This API is used for creating and destroying swarms and resources,
            | adding and removing resources from swarms, and generating API keys. In addition to these configuration
            | methods, the RESTful API also takes care of the social aspect of BUGswarm, sending invitations to other users' 
            | resources to join your swarms as well as accepting and rejecting pending invitations. The RESTful API is not
            | a streaming API. For each method called, connections are closed after the requests are processed. To make 
            | development easier, the configuration API has been wrapped up in 
            a(href='http://github.com/buglabs/bugswarm-tools') BUGswarm Tools
            | , a set of python scripts used to make the development process simple and easy.

            | BUGswarm makes use of an HTTP streaming API to participate in a
            | swarm. The streaming API is used for producing to and consuming
            | data from a swarm. While it uses HTTP requests, the streaming API is 
            strong not RESTful
            | . For each method call, connections remain open while bidirectional HTTP requests are processed.
            | The streaming API has been wrapped in a set of  
            a(href='libraries.html') libraries 
            | that make it easy to get your resources participating in swarms as soon as possible. In addition to these
            | libraries, 
            a(href='http://github.com/buglabs/bugswarm-tools') BUGswarm Tools 
            | contains produce and consume scripts that allow for simple
            | command line use of the participation API.
