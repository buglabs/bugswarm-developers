        | The BUGswarm API can be broken down into two primary sections, configuration and participation.
        | Configuration includes the creation, updating, and destruction of swarms and their resources.
        | Participation inclues producing and consuming data within one or many swarms.

            | BUGswarm uses a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API for configuring swarms
            | and their resources. This API is used for creating and destroying swarms and resources,
            | adding and removing resources from swarms, and generating API keys. The RESTful API is not
            | a streaming API. For each method called, connections are closed after the requests are processed.

            | BUGswarm makes use of an HTTP streaming API to participate in a
            | configured swarm. The streaming API is used for producing and consuming
            | data from a swarm. While it uses HTTP requests, the streaming API is 
            strong not RESTful
            | . For each method call, connections remain open while bidirectional HTTP requests are processed.
            | The streaming API has been wrapped in a set of  
            a(href='libraries.html') libraries 
            | that make it easy to get your resources participating in swarms as soon as possible.
