        Let's say Prometheus and Bob have a shopping list for their brand new cave.
        They both hunt in different jungles, and have a common set of supplies
        needed for the winter:

          * impala meat
          * flint
          * red vine fruit
          * snakeskin

        Last year both had made a similar list before hunting, but when they joined
        up before winter found that both had found way too much impala meat and no
        flint to cook it with!

        This year, they have shiny new smartphones and decide to make a synced todo
        list that can be checked at each hunter's convinience. The lists should update
        silently to not scare away any impala.

        Lets start with Bob's job - make the website:

        So Bob might not win any design awards but he at least included the .js files for Prometheus.

        And now here is Prometheus' code:
