      h2 API Libraries
        p BUGswarm makes use of two primary APIs for configuring and participating in swarms:
        .row
          .span8
            h3: a(href='rest_api.html') REST API
            p
              | BUGswarm uses a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API for configuring swarms
              | and their resources.
              | This API is used for creating and destroying swarms and resources,
              | adding and removing resources from swarms, and generating API keys.
              | The REST API is different from the Streaming API, though they both are exposed over HTTP.
              | For each method call in the REST API, connections are closed after HTTP requests are processed.
          .span8
            h3: a(href='streaming_api.html') Streaming API
            p
              | The BUGswarm Streaming API is used by users and resources to participate in a
              | configured swarm. It is used for producing and consuming information from a swarm.
              | The Streaming API uses HTTP requests, but
              strong is not RESTful
              | . For each method call in the Streaming API, connections remain open while HTTP requests are processed
