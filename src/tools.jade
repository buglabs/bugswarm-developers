        | In order to abstract some of the tedious work associated with using our 
        a(href='restful_api.html') RESTful API 
        | to configure swarms and resources, we have developed a set of tools make 
        | the BUGswarm development workflow even easier. Built in Python, 
        a(href='https://github.com/buglabs/bugswarm-tools') BUGswarm Tools 
        | removes any need for curl and nicely formats the JSON returned by some of the methods in the API.
